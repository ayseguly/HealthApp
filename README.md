# HealthApp
HealthApp is an app which is developing for a purpose of "Using Games to Design a User Interface for the Treatment and Prevention of Parkinson, Alzheimer's, and Dementia"
The cognitive abnormalities that are characteristic of the early stages of Parkinson, Alzheimer, and Dementia may be accurately diagnosed with the use of neuropsychological evaluations and testing. 

The following are some of the goals that we hope to accomplish with this research:

Improving the cognitive tests that are administered to persons suspected of having Parkinson's disease, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease to aid in making a diagnosis of one of these diseases.
Utilizing the available technical resources to create the software that, once installed, would make these mental examinations usable on Android smartphones. This is the first phase.
Using the program on groups of people who have a cognitive level that is considered normal as well as groups of people who have been diagnosed with these disorders.
Determining whether or not there is a connection between the program and a test that is given regularly.

ðŸ”¹At the beginning of this project, it was aimed to develop an application that could be beneficial for some dementia patients. More than fifty articles were reviewed and interviews were conducted with patients and their relatives. The application was made for a master degree course project, if you want to reach scientific studies and project paper, you can contact me.
 I designed this application to have different interfaces in different user logins so that it can be used by both patients and their relatives and doctors who follow the treatment.
 Here some screenshots from the application interface

 The user may try out actions that he wishes to solve by playing games on this screen, which are shown on the screen. By pressing the buttons that access the seven different activity tabs, the user has the ability to begin any activity.
